Visual Basic for Applications
NBA player statistical comparison generator - VBA

Statistically who is the better NBA player?

Compare NBA players by adding the total amount of rebounds, assists, steals, blocks and points for one season together. After calculating a player’s total per season, compare the players best 6 seasons with another player.

The seasonal statistical data is from https://www.basketball-reference.com/.

A process was developed using VBA to add a player’s name to a table and create a spreadsheet that would hold the players data. The data would have to be copied manually from the respective basketball reference site. VBA was used to calculate the totals for each season. 

A spreadsheet with the data from two players would be created using VBA. First you would choose the first player from the dashboard sheet, then in a special list box using VBA choose a second player. VBA was necessary for the second box, to prevent someone from choosing the same player twice. 

A spreadsheet containing the players 6 best seasons (12 seasons total) would be generated and formatted. A CSV file for visualization would have to be created manually.  

This project had a 4-day deadline, so the most necessary aspects were automated. Future releases will include automation for additional formatting, error correction and player data import and export.
